-- The content of the Oracle afterMigrate__fix_invalid_objects.sql file is a command that re-compiles any invalid database objects.
-- This is required because objects such as procedures, which are managed in repeatable migrations, can have dependencies
-- on other objects but Flyway runs all repeatable migrations in alphabetical order regardless of any dependencies.
-- Therefore some objects may not be properly compiled after flyway migrate completes.
